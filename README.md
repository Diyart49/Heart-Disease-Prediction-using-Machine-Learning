Despite the continuous advancements in medical technology, heart disease persists as a leading cause of death worldwide. Many individuals remain unaware of their risk factors or lack access to timely screenings. Additionally, there is a shortage of personalized tools available to accurately assess individual risk, resulting in a gap in proactive heart health management.
To address this issue, CARDIOCARE offers a user-friendly heart disease prediction application. By employing MySQL for data storage and Python for the backend, the app efficiently gathers and analyzes users' health parameters to generate personalized risk assessments. Utilizing machine learning techniques, the app's algorithm processes the data to predict the likelihood of heart disease for each user.

I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

Machine Learning algorithms used:
1.Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
2.Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
3.Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
4.K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
5.Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
